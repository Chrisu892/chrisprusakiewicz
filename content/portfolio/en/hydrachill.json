The trick to success was to make sure that the video is in the focal point for a little bit longer while users scroll down the homepage to explore the key features of the machine and stay longer on the homepage.</p>",

  "content2": "<p>How to make the video stay in place while users scroll down the page, and how to maximise legibility of the text on top without compromising the video clarity?</p><p>The trick is to add a subtle, semi-transparent layer between video and text. Consequently, users are able to read the content while the video plays in the background. However, don't forget to add autoplay and muted attributes to the video tag, otherwise video won't play! It's also important to add playsinline attribute, so that the video autoplays on mobile devices.</p>",

That way, users can decide themselves if they want to learn more or not. Webpages donâ€™t have to be loaded with lots of text.</p><p>This project is a perfect example of how video could make a big difference on how your website conveys information about your products or services.</p>"
